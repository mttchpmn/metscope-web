# Metscope (beta)

## Overview

MetScope is an aggregation platform for the various sources of weather, webcam, and operational safety information for commercial pilots in New Zealand. MetScope arose out of the discrepancy between the vast (and confusing) number of information sources available to pilots, and the disappointing lack of effective ways to access said information. As a public beta, MetScope is currently free to access and still in active development.

## FAQ

### Can I use MetScope operationally?

No. MetScope is ADVISORY ONLY - for mission critical briefing information you should refer to the relevant issuing authority.

### Where do you get the weather information from?

This is sourced from IFIS directly, and the information is retrieved on a 10 minute interval. MetScope does not make any guarantee as to the accuracy nor completeness of the information while in public beta, hence ADVISORY ONLY.

### Where do you get the webcams from?

The webcams are all publicly available webcams hosted by a variety of providers. MetScope retrieves the webcam imagery on a set interval (normally ~10min) and saves them to the MetScope database. This allows for the 'timelapsing' functionality.

### Why can't I log in to MetScope and customise / save favorites etc?

This is planned functionality for the not too distant future. Stay tuned!

### Does MetScope already have a user base?

Yes, numerous pilots, aviation operators and adventure tourism operators are already adopting MetScope to aid their operational situational awareness.
